# Friend Finder
This is a Laravel web-app created by myself and 3 teammates for a CMPT 470 (Web Information Systems) project. The idea behind the app is to provide SFU CMPT students a convenient way to meet other students in their classes who share common interests and educational backgrounds.

Users can search for friends in any class in the SFU CMPT catalogue and filter based on interests / educational background. Friendships can be created/deleted. Other features include user-to-user messaging, and public meetup announcemnets.
